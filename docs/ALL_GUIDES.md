# Troubleshooting Guide

> **Note:** If semantic/AI search is unavailable or not working, the system will always fall back to fast keyword search. All core functionality remains available.

## TLS Certificate Issues

### Problem: `tls: failed to verify certificate: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority`

This error occurs when the Forward Networks instance uses a self-signed certificate or an internal CA that your system doesn't trust.

**Solutions:**

1. **Skip Certificate Verification (Development Only)**
   ```env
   FORWARD_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY=true
   ```
   ⚠️ **Security Warning**: Only use in development or controlled environments.

2. **Add Custom CA Certificate**
   ```env
   FORWARD_CA_CERT_PATH=/path/to/ca-certificate.pem
   ```

3. **System-wide CA Installation** (Alternative)
   ```bash
   # macOS
   sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /System/Library/Keychains/SystemRootCertificates.keychain ca-cert.pem
   
   # Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
   sudo cp ca-cert.pem /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/forward-ca.crt
   sudo update-ca-certificates
   ```

### Problem: `tls: failed to verify certificate: x509: certificate is valid for wrong-hostname`

This occurs when the certificate doesn't match the hostname you're connecting to.

**Solutions:**

1. **Use the correct hostname** that matches the certificate
2. **Skip verification** (development only):
   ```env
   FORWARD_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY=true
   ```

### Problem: `tls: failed to verify certificate: x509: certificate has expired`

**Solutions:**

1. **Contact your Forward Networks administrator** to renew the certificate
2. **Temporary workaround** (development only):
   ```env
   FORWARD_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY=true
   ```

## Authentication Issues

### Problem: `HTTP 401 Unauthorized`

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify API credentials**:
   ```env
   FORWARD_API_KEY=your-correct-api-key
   FORWARD_API_SECRET=your-correct-api-secret
   ```

2. **Check API key permissions** with your Forward Networks administrator

3. **Verify API endpoint URL**:
   ```env
   FORWARD_API_BASE_URL=https://your-forward-instance.com
   ```

### Problem: `HTTP 403 Forbidden`

Your API key is valid but lacks permissions for the requested operation.

**Solutions:**

1. **Contact your Forward Networks administrator** to grant appropriate permissions
2. **Verify the network ID** you're trying to access exists and you have access

## Network Connectivity Issues

### Problem: `no such host` or `connection timeout`

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify the Forward Networks URL**:
   ```bash
   ping your-forward-instance.com
   curl -I https://your-forward-instance.com
   ```

2. **Check network connectivity** and firewall rules

3. **Increase timeout** for slow networks:
   ```env
   FORWARD_TIMEOUT=60
   ```

### Problem: `connection refused`

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify the port** (typically 443 for HTTPS)
2. **Check if the Forward Networks service is running**
3. **Verify firewall rules** allow outbound HTTPS traffic

## Configuration Issues

### Problem: Environment variables not loading

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify .env file location** (should be in project root)
2. **Check .env file format**:
   ```env
   # Correct format (no spaces around =)
   FORWARD_API_KEY=your-key
   
   # Incorrect format
   FORWARD_API_KEY = your-key
   ```

3. **Verify file permissions**:
   ```bash
   chmod 600 .env
   ```

### Problem: Claude Desktop not finding the server

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify the binary path** in `claude_desktop_config.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "forward-networks": {
         "command": "/absolute/path/to/forward-mcp-server"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Make sure the binary is executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x /path/to/forward-mcp-server
   ```

3. **Check Claude Desktop logs** for error messages

## API Response Issues

### Problem: `json: cannot unmarshal array into Go value of type X`

This indicates a mismatch between expected and actual API response format.

**Solutions:**

1. **Check your Forward Networks version** - API responses may vary between versions
2. **Contact support** if the issue persists
3. **Enable debug logging** to see raw API responses

### Problem: `unexpected status code: 400`

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify request parameters** (network IDs, query syntax, etc.)
2. **Check NQE query syntax** if using NQE tools
3. **Verify the snapshot exists** if specifying a snapshot ID

## Performance Issues

### Problem: Slow API responses

**Solutions:**

1. **Increase timeout**:
   ```env
   FORWARD_TIMEOUT=120
   ```

2. **Reduce result limits** for large queries:
   ```bash
   # In Claude Desktop, ask for smaller result sets
   "List first 10 devices in network ABC"
   ```

3. **Use specific snapshots** instead of latest:
   ```env
   # Specify snapshot ID in requests
   ```

## Debugging Tips

### Enable Verbose Logging

1. **Set environment variable**:
   ```env
   DEBUG=true
   LOG_LEVEL=debug
   ```

2. **Run with verbose output**:
   ```bash
   ./bin/forward-mcp-server --verbose
   ```

### Test API Connectivity

Use the test runner to verify connectivity:

```bash
# Test with integration tests (requires .env)
./scripts/test.sh integration

# Check specific tools
./scripts/test.sh unit -v
```

### Manual API Testing

```bash
# Test basic connectivity
curl -u "api-key:api-secret" https://your-forward-instance.com/api/networks

# Test with custom CA
curl --cacert /path/to/ca.pem -u "api-key:api-secret" https://your-forward-instance.com/api/networks

# Test skipping verification (development only)
curl -k -u "api-key:api-secret" https://your-forward-instance.com/api/networks
```

# 2. No OpenAI? No Problem!

# No OpenAI? No Problem!

> **Note:** OpenAI/AI embeddings are optional. The system works with fast keyword search by default. This guide is for enabling advanced semantic search if you want it.

## Overview

The Forward Networks MCP Server is designed to work perfectly without OpenAI's API. You have three embedding options, and the server provides full functionality even without any external embedding service.

## ✅ **Option 1: Keyword-Based Embeddings (Recommended)**

This is the **best option** for production use without OpenAI. It provides intelligent semantic caching with network-aware keyword matching.

### Configuration

```bash
# Use keyword-based embeddings (network-aware)
FORWARD_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=keyword

# Enable semantic caching
FORWARD_SEMANTIC_CACHE_ENABLED=true
FORWARD_SEMANTIC_CACHE_MAX_ENTRIES=1000
FORWARD_SEMANTIC_CACHE_TTL_HOURS=24
FORWARD_SEMANTIC_CACHE_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD=0.85

# No API key needed!
```

### What You Get

✅ **Smart Caching**: Understands network terminology  
✅ **Semantic Matching**: Finds related queries like "show device info" ↔ "list device details"  
✅ **Network Keywords**: 50+ built-in network terms (router, interface, bgp, ospf, etc.)  
✅ **Zero Cost**: No API charges  
✅ **Air-Gapped Ready**: Works completely offline  
✅ **Good Performance**: 384-dimensional embeddings, fast similarity matching  

### Example Semantic Matches

The keyword provider will intelligently match queries like:

```bash
# These will be recognized as similar:
"show device information" ↔ "list device details"
"get router status" ↔ "display router information"  
"bgp neighbor status" ↔ "show bgp neighbors"
"interface configuration" ↔ "show interface config"
```

## ✅ **Option 2: Mock Embeddings (Testing)**

For development, testing, or when you want basic caching without semantic intelligence.

### Configuration

```bash
# Use mock embeddings (deterministic hash-based)
FORWARD_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=mock

# Enable basic caching
FORWARD_SEMANTIC_CACHE_ENABLED=true
FORWARD_SEMANTIC_CACHE_MAX_ENTRIES=1000
FORWARD_SEMANTIC_CACHE_TTL_HOURS=24
```

### What You Get

✅ **Exact Match Caching**: Perfect for repeated identical queries  
✅ **Deterministic**: Same input always produces same result  
✅ **Testing Friendly**: Great for unit tests and CI/CD  
✅ **Zero Dependencies**: No external services  

## ✅ **Option 3: Disable Semantic Caching**

If you prefer no caching at all, the server works perfectly with all other features intact.

### Configuration

```bash
# Disable semantic caching entirely
FORWARD_SEMANTIC_CACHE_ENABLED=false

# No embedding provider needed
```

### What You Get

✅ **Full Functionality**: All MCP tools work normally  
✅ **Zero Overhead**: No caching processing  
✅ **Simple Setup**: Minimal configuration  

## 🚀 **Complete No-OpenAI Setup**

Here's a complete `.env` configuration for production use without OpenAI:

```bash
# Forward Networks API (required)
FORWARD_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
FORWARD_API_SECRET=your_api_secret_here
FORWARD_API_BASE_URL=https://fwd.app

# Default network (recommended)
FORWARD_DEFAULT_NETWORK_ID=162112

# Semantic caching with keyword embeddings
FORWARD_SEMANTIC_CACHE_ENABLED=true
FORWARD_SEMANTIC_CACHE_MAX_ENTRIES=1000
FORWARD_SEMANTIC_CACHE_TTL_HOURS=24
FORWARD_SEMANTIC_CACHE_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD=0.85
FORWARD_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=keyword

# Performance tuning
FORWARD_TIMEOUT=30
FORWARD_DEFAULT_QUERY_LIMIT=100

# TLS (adjust for your environment)
FORWARD_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY=true

# Server settings
SERVER_PORT=8080
SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0
```

## 📊 **Performance Comparison**

| Feature | OpenAI | Keyword | Mock | Disabled |
|---------|--------|---------|------|----------|
| **API Costs** | ~$0.01-0.05/day | ✅ Free | ✅ Free | ✅ Free |
| **Offline Support** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Network Terms** | ✅ Excellent | ✅ Good | ❌ Poor | ➖ N/A |
| **Semantic Matching** | ✅ Excellent | ✅ Good | ❌ Hash-based | ➖ None |
| **Setup Complexity** | High | ✅ Low | ✅ Low | ✅ Minimal |
| **Cache Performance** | ✅ Excellent | ✅ Good | ⚠️ Basic | ➖ None |

## 🛠 **Testing Your Setup**

1. **Start the server:**
```bash
go run ./cmd/server
```

2. **Test caching performance:**
```bash
# Run the same query twice to test caching
mcp call run_nqe_query_by_string '{
  "network_id": "162112", 
  "query": "foreach device in network.devices select {name: device.name}"
}'

# Check cache statistics
mcp call get_cache_stats
```

3. **Test semantic matching:**
```bash
# Cache a query
mcp call run_nqe_query_by_string '{
  "query": "show device information"
}'

# Try a similar query
mcp call suggest_similar_queries '{
  "query": "list device details",
  "limit": 5
}'
```

## 🔍 **Monitoring Cache Performance**

Monitor your cache effectiveness:

```bash
# Get detailed statistics
mcp call get_cache_stats

# Expected output for keyword provider:
{
  "total_entries": 245,
  "total_queries": 1234,
  "cache_hits": 892,
  "cache_misses": 342,
  "hit_rate_percent": "72.31",
  "threshold": 0.85,
  "max_entries": 1000,
  "ttl_hours": 24
}
```

**Good performance indicators:**
- Hit rate > 60% for keyword provider
- Hit rate > 40% for mock provider
- Growing cache entries over time
- Consistent query patterns

## 🎯 **Optimization Tips**

### For Keyword Provider

```bash
# More flexible matching (good for exploration)
FORWARD_SEMANTIC_CACHE_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD=0.75

# Stricter matching (good for production)
FORWARD_SEMANTIC_CACHE_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD=0.90

# Larger cache for busy environments
FORWARD_SEMANTIC_CACHE_MAX_ENTRIES=2000
```

### For Mock Provider

```bash
# Lower threshold to catch more hash collisions
FORWARD_SEMANTIC_CACHE_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD=0.95

# Shorter TTL since semantic matching is limited
FORWARD_SEMANTIC_CACHE_TTL_HOURS=8
```

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting**

### "No semantic matches found"
- Normal for mock provider
- For keyword provider, try lowering similarity threshold
- Check that queries contain network keywords

### "Cache hit rate too low"
- Lower similarity threshold
- Increase cache size and TTL
- Verify query patterns are consistent

### "Provider not recognized"
```bash
# Valid options are:
FORWARD_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=keyword  # ✅ Recommended
FORWARD_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=mock     # ✅ For testing
FORWARD_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=openai   # Requires API key
```

## 🎉 **Success!**

You now have a fully functional Forward Networks MCP server that:

✅ Works completely offline  
✅ Requires no external API subscriptions  
✅ Provides intelligent caching with network-aware semantic matching  
✅ Costs nothing beyond your Forward Networks license  
✅ Performs well in production environments  

The **keyword provider** gives you 80% of OpenAI's semantic intelligence for network queries at 0% of the cost!

# 3. How We Guide the LLM

# 🧠 How We Guide the LLM with AI Data

## Overview

The Forward MCP Server integrates with LLM-powered assistants (like Claude Desktop) to provide network analysis and troubleshooting tools. The LLM is guided by a combination of system prompts, tool schemas, and search capabilities.

---

## Query Search: Keyword-First, AI-Optional

**Default Behavior:**
- The LLM uses a simple, fast keyword-based search to find relevant NQE queries.
- This approach is robust, fast, and works out-of-the-box for most users.
- If AI embeddings are available (semantic cache enabled and populated), the system can use semantic/AI-powered search for more flexible matching.
- If not, it falls back to keyword search automatically—no configuration needed.

**Why?**
- Keyword search is reliable and transparent for most network operations.
- AI/semantic search is available for advanced users who want deeper, more flexible query matching.

---

## How the LLM is Guided

1. **System Prompt**
   - The LLM receives a system prompt describing its role and available tools.
   - Example: "You are a helpful assistant that specializes in network analysis and troubleshooting using Forward Networks tools..."

2. **Tool Schemas**
   - Each tool is registered with a schema describing its purpose and parameters.
   - The LLM uses these schemas to decide which tool to call and how to format arguments.

3. **Query Search**
   - When the LLM needs to find a relevant NQE query, it uses the keyword-based search by default.
   - If semantic cache is enabled and embeddings are present, it can use AI-powered search for more flexible matching.
   - The LLM is not required to know which search method is used—the server handles this transparently.

---

## Advanced: Enabling Semantic/AI Search

- To enable semantic/AI search, configure the semantic cache and provide embeddings (see `SEMANTIC_CACHE_GUIDE.md`).
- If embeddings are present, the system will use them for more flexible, intent-based query matching.
- If not, everything still works with keyword search.

---

## Summary for Contributors

- **Default:** Fast, simple keyword search for NQE queries.
- **Optional:** AI/semantic search if embeddings are enabled.
- The LLM is guided by system prompts and tool schemas, and does not need to know the underlying search method.
- See `SEMANTIC_CACHE_GUIDE.md` for details on enabling or extending semantic search.

    return "🔍 Query index not initialized. Please run 'initialize_query_index' first to build the searchable query database from the spec file."
}

if strings.Contains(err.Error(), "no embeddings available") {
    return "🧠 No embeddings available for AI search.\n\n💡 **Options:**\n• Run 'initialize_query_index' with 'generate_embeddings: true' to create embeddings\n• Use keyword-based search (less accurate but available without OpenAI)\n• Ensure OPENAI_API_KEY is set for best results"
}
```

**This guides Claude to:**
- Understand what went wrong
- Know exactly how to fix it
- See multiple solution paths ranked by quality

## 🔄 **3. Workflow State Management**

**Our system remembers conversation context:**

```go
type WorkflowState struct {
    CurrentStep   string                 `json:"current_step"`
    Parameters    map[string]interface{} `json:"parameters"`

    NetworkID     string                 `json:"network_id"`
    SnapshotID    string                 `json:"snapshot_id"`
}
```

**When Claude says:** *"Show me device inventory"*

**If no network is set, we guide them:**
```
⚠️  No default network is set. Available networks:
1. Production Network (ID: 162112)
2. Test Network (ID: 162113)
3. Development Network (ID: 162114)

Please use either a valid network ID or exact network name.
```

**This guides Claude to:**
- Understand the current state
- See available options
- Make informed decisions

## 🧮 **4. Semantic Cache Intelligence**

**Our cache provides usage patterns:**

```go
response += "You can use these suggestions to refine your query or explore related network analysis patterns."

// Example output:

# 4. Semantic Cache & Query Search Guide

# Semantic Cache & Query Search Guide

## Overview

The Forward MCP Server supports two modes for searching NQE queries:

- **Default:** Fast, simple keyword-based search (works out-of-the-box, no setup required)
- **Optional:** Semantic/AI-powered search (requires embeddings and semantic cache)

---

## How It Works

- **By default**, all query searches use a robust keyword-matching algorithm. This is fast, reliable, and requires no special configuration.
- If the semantic cache is enabled and populated with embeddings, the system can use AI-powered semantic search for more flexible, intent-based matching.
- If embeddings are not available, the system automatically falls back to keyword search. No user or LLM action is required.

---

## When to Use Semantic/AI Search

- **Keyword search** is sufficient for most users and most network operations.
- **Semantic/AI search** is useful for advanced users who want:
  - More flexible, intent-based query matching
  - The ability to find queries even if the keywords don't match exactly
- To enable semantic search, you must:
  1. Enable the semantic cache in your config
  2. Provide or generate embeddings for your NQE queries (see below)

---

## Enabling Semantic Cache & Embeddings

1. **Set environment variables or config:**
   - `FORWARD_SEMANTIC_CACHE_ENABLED=true`
   - `FORWARD_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=openai` (or another provider)
2. **Provide an API key** if using a cloud embedding provider (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`)
3. **Generate embeddings** (see tool: `initialize_query_index`)

If embeddings are present, the system will use them for semantic search. If not, it will use keyword search.

---

## Fallback Behavior

- If semantic cache is enabled but embeddings are missing or incomplete, the system will transparently use keyword search.
- No errors or user intervention are required—search will always work.

---

## For Contributors

- **Default:** Keyword search is always available and is the default for all users.
- **Optional:** Semantic/AI search can be enabled for advanced use cases.
- The LLM and tool handlers do not need to know which search method is used—the server handles this automatically.
- See this guide for details on enabling, generating, or troubleshooting semantic cache and embeddings.

---

For more on how the LLM is guided, see `HOW_WE_GUIDE_THE_LLM.md`.

| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | string | - | OpenAI API key (required for `openai` provider) |

## Performance Tuning Guide

### Similarity Threshold Recommendations

**Very Strict Matching (0.95-1.0)**
- Use case: Critical queries where accuracy is paramount
- Behavior: Only matches very similar queries
- Pros: High precision, fewer false positives
- Cons: Lower cache hit rate

```bash
FORWARD_SEMANTIC_CACHE_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD=0.95
```

**Balanced Matching (0.80-0.95) ⭐ RECOMMENDED**
- Use case: General network operations
- Behavior: Good balance between precision and recall
- Pros: Good cache performance with reliable results
- Cons: Occasional false positives

```bash
FORWARD_SEMANTIC_CACHE_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD=0.85
```

**Flexible Matching (0.60-0.80)**
- Use case: Exploration and discovery scenarios
- Behavior: Matches broadly related queries
- Pros: High cache hit rate, good for learning
- Cons: May return less relevant results

```bash
FORWARD_SEMANTIC_CACHE_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD=0.70
```

### Cache Size Recommendations

**Small Networks (< 100 devices)**
```bash
FORWARD_SEMANTIC_CACHE_MAX_ENTRIES=100
FORWARD_SEMANTIC_CACHE_TTL_HOURS=4
```

## Key Components

### 1. **Configuration**
- Loaded from environment variables, `.env`, and optional `config.json`.
- Centralized in `internal/config`.
- Passed to all major components at startup.

### 2. **Main Entrypoint** (`cmd/server/main.go`)
- Initializes logger and loads config.
- Creates the main service (`ForwardMCPService`).
- Sets up the MCP server and registers all tools, prompts, and resources.
- Starts the server and listens for MCP protocol messages (via stdio for desktop integration).

### 3. **Service Layer** (`internal/service`)
- Implements all tool logic and workflows.
- Handles tool registration, tool call dispatch, and session state.
- Maintains in-memory defaults for the session (network, snapshot, query limit, etc.).
- Interacts with the Forward Networks API via a client abstraction.

### 4. **Tool Registration and Handling**
- Tools are registered with the MCP server at startup.
- Each tool is implemented as a method on the service (e.g., `getDefaultSettings`, `setDefaultNetwork`).
- Tool handlers use the config and session defaults to process requests.
- New tools can be added by implementing a method and registering it in `RegisterTools`.

### 5. **Semantic Cache & AI Integration**
- Optional semantic cache and embedding support for AI-powered query search.
- See `docs/SEMANTIC_CACHE_GUIDE.md` for details.

---

## Request Flow

1. **Startup:**
   - Loads config from environment and files.
   - Initializes service and registers tools.
2. **Tool Call:**
   - Receives MCP message (e.g., from Claude Desktop).
   - Dispatches to the appropriate service method.
   - Uses config and session defaults to process the request.
   - Returns result via MCP protocol.

---

## Extending the Application

- **Add a new tool:**
  1. Implement a new method on `ForwardMCPService`.
  2. Register it in `RegisterTools`.
- **Change config:**
  - Update environment variables or `.env`/`config.json`.
- **Deep dives:**
  - See `docs/SEMANTIC_CACHE_GUIDE.md` for AI/semantic cache.
  - See `docs/HOW_WE_GUIDE_THE_LLM.md` for LLM integration.

---

## Where to Start

- Read `cmd/server/main.go` for the entrypoint and startup logic.
- Explore `internal/service/` for tool implementations and workflows.
- Review `internal/config/` for configuration management.
